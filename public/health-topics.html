                    <h4>Menstrual Health</h4>
                    <p>Understanding your menstrual cycle is crucial for overall reproductive health. Regular cycles typically range from 21 to 35 days. The menstrual cycle consists of four main phases: menstruation, the follicular phase, ovulation, and the luteal phase. Each phase is characterized by hormonal changes that affect the body in various ways.</p>
                    <div class="info-box">Symptoms like severe pain, heavy bleeding, or irregular cycles should be discussed with a healthcare provider as they may indicate underlying conditions such as endometriosis, PCOS, or thyroid disorders.</div>

                    <h4>Contraception</h4>
                    <p>There are numerous contraception options available, each with its own benefits and considerations:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Hormonal methods: Pills, patches, injections, vaginal rings</li>
                        <li>Barrier methods: Male and female condoms, diaphragms, cervical caps</li>
                        <li>Long-acting reversible contraceptives (LARCs): IUDs (hormonal and non-hormonal), implants</li>
                        <li>Permanent methods: Tubal ligation, vasectomy</li>
                        <li>Natural family planning methods: Fertility awareness-based methods</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Efficacy, side effects, convenience, and personal health factors should be considered when choosing a method. Consult with a healthcare provider to find the best option for your individual needs.</p>

                    <h4>Fertility and Conception</h4>
                    <p>Fertility is influenced by various factors including age, overall health, and lifestyle choices. To optimize fertility:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Understand your menstrual cycle and ovulation patterns</li>
                        <li>Maintain a healthy diet rich in folic acid, iron, and other essential nutrients</li>
                        <li>Exercise regularly, but avoid excessive physical strain</li>
                        <li>Manage stress through relaxation techniques or counseling</li>
                        <li>Avoid smoking, excessive alcohol consumption, and recreational drugs</li>
                        <li>Consider preconception health checks and genetic counseling</li>
                    </ul>
